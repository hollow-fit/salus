# salus
A health tracking application that serves as a central hub for personal health. 

File Summary:

Files of type CSV will be placed manually/automatically in a specific folder. The folder
will then be monitored by a filewater. The program will then parse and process
the data. Once data has been organized into an appropriate format it will be
loaded into a DB by a DB loader. The data will then be pulled from the database
by a puller. The puller will populate graphs, return summary infomration,
calculate statistics and present that information in an easy and interactive
graphical display.
